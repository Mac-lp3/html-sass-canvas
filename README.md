# What is this?
It is a bare-bones project skeleton for any time you want to quickly start
playing around with a SASS based front end build.

It comes with gulp-sass and browser-sync ready for browser auto-refresh and
watching your sass to recompile.

The project follows SMACSS structure and comes with bootstrap.

# How do I use it?
```
git checkout https://github.com/Mac-lp3/html-sass-canvas.git
npm install
npm start
```

# Why did you do this?
Busy week at work prototyping like 20 websites for a business team that wouldn't
make up their mind.

# This must already exists somewhere...
Yeah, but this is the way I like it. Plus you gotta get those commits...
