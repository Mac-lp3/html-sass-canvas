# What is this?
It is a bare-bones project skeleton for any time you want to quickly start
playing around with a SASS based front end build. Comes with gulp-sass and
browser-sync to auto refresh the browser and compile your sass. The project
follows SMACSS structure.

# How do I use it?
```
git checkout https://github.com/Mac-lp3/html-sass-canvas.git
npm install
npm start
```

# Why did you do this?
Busy week at work prototyping like 20 websites for a business team that wouldn't
make up their mind.

# This must already exists somewhere...
Yeah, but this is the way I like it. Plus you gotta get those commits...
